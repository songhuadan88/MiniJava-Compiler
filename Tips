Grammar on MiniJava:
There is only one function in the MainClass.
There are only four types, int bool int[] Object, except the main function.

Type errors to detect:
Wrong returned type. Binary-tree, Linked-list
Undefined variable. Bubble-sort 76, Tree-visitor 339
[] only matches with Array. Line-search 37, Quicksort 42
Left type and right type of * does not match, Factorial 13
Number of parameters of method doea not match. Morethan4

Piglet:
If a class has n variables, then it should allocate 4n+4 bytes.
The first 4 bytes are used to store the list of functions, and others are used to store variables.
TEMP 1-20 is used to be the varaibles of functions.
TEMP is considered local variable inside a function.

Kanga:
label are now global
24 global registers:
a0-a3 parameter
v0 return value
v1 temporary values when loading from stack
s0-s7 t0-t9 general use

ASTORE ALOAD interact with stack
PASSARG to make more than 4 parameters viable

Procedures have three integers in its head
the first is the number of parameters
the second is the maximum of numbers that the procedure may use the stack
the third is the maximum of numbers of parameters of the producers that this producer may call
