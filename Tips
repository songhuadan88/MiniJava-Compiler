Grammar on MiniJava:
There is only one function in the MainClass.
There are only four types, int bool int[] Object, except the main function.

Type errors to detect:
Wrong returned type. Binary-tree, Linked-list
Undefined variable. Bubble-sort 76, Tree-visitor 339
[] only matches with Array. Line-search 37, Quicksort 42
Left type and right type of * does not match, Factorial 13
Number of parameters of method doea not match. Morethan4

Piglet:
If a class has n variables, then it should allocate 4n+4 bytes.
The first 4 bytes are used to store the list of functions, and others are used to store variables.
TEMP 1-20 is used to be the varaibles of functions.
TEMP is considered local variable inside a function.
